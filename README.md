# Syntax highlighting for vscode
Package for syntax highlighting for GAMS in vscode 

The Gams.tmLanguage file from the (https://github.com/lolow/gams) repository was used as a starting point for the development of this repository. The file was converted to JSON format and changes were made to fit the syntax for the MAKRO project at DREAM (https://dreamgruppen.dk/).

## Features
